### Cattpuccin wallpapers:
This repository includes a set of catppuccin-wallpapers I found in other repositories on github.

Albeit I only took the mocha variations.

### Usage:
Dependencies:
```bash
git, Any wallpaper engine
```
Cloning:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nnyyxxxx/catppuccin-wallpapers
cd catppuccin-wallpapers
mv mocha-wall "$HOME"
```
How to randomize these?:
- Assuming you're using feh you can use this command:
```bash
feh --randomize --bg-fill ~/mocha-wall/*
```
And set this as a keybinding, for your DE / WM.
